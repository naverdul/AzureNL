# Virtual machines

## Introduction
This script will help you create a virtual machine in Azure and its dependencies. A virtual machine lives in a subnet in a virtual network and it can be reached using a public ip address. For simplicity this is the first approach.

A security best practice is to not connect directly to over SSH/RDP but use a jumpbox like Azure Bastion in between. This will be the second approach.
